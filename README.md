# Beluga

Beluga makes it more convenient for users to create an ad-hoc distance measurement network. Users can enter different types of AT commands through serial monitor to configure the properties of the DWM1001-DEV board. For example, change the channel of the UWB signal and polling frequency. These features enable users to customize their own network setup and meet the requirements. Beluga can be applied in the area of localization, robotics, and infrastructure sensing.
